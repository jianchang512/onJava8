If you like it, considering giving back by sending a pull request. Here are a few tips:</p><ul><li>Read the <a href="http://prismjs.com/extending.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a>. Prism was designed to be extensible.</li><li>Do not edit <code>prism.js</code>, it’s just the version of Prism used by the Prism website and is built automatically. Limit your changes to the unminified files in the components/ folder. The minified files are also generated automatically.</li><li>The build system uses <a href="https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">gulp</a> to minify the files and build <code>prism.js</code>. Having gulp installed, you just need to run the command <code>gulp</code>.</li><li>Please follow the code conventions used in the files already. For example, I use <a href="http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment</a>. Opening braces are on the same line, closing braces on their own line regardless of construct. There is a space before the opening brace. etc etc.</li><li>Please try to err towards more smaller PRs rather than few huge PRs. If a PR includes changes I want to merge and changes I don&#39;t, handling it becomes difficult.</li><li>My time is very limited these days, so it might take a long time to review longer PRs (short ones are usually merged very quickly), especially those modifying the Prism Core. This doesn&#39;t mean your PR is rejected.</li><li>If you contribute a new language definition, you will be responsible for handling bug reports about that language definition.</li><li>If you add a new language definition, theme or plugin, you need to add it to <code>components.json</code> as well and rebuild Prism by running <code>gulp</code>, so that it becomes available to the download build page.</li></ul><p>Thank you so much for contributing!!</p><h2 id="translations" tabindex="-1">Translations <a class="header-anchor" href="#translations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Translations&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><a href="http://www.awesomes.cn/repo/PrismJS/prism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="http://awesomes.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/readme.png" alt="中文说明"></a></li></ul>',12),o=[s];function n(l,m,h,c,d,p){return t(),r("div",null,o)}const f=e(i,[["render",n]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
